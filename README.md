### [Golf Simulator](https://github.com/taylor-peters/Python-Projects/commit/803c0541b9fbeb8f5f7beaa37835996d27062324)
Based on fundamentals covered in The Tech Academy's "Nice/Mean" game assignment, I developed this rudimentary golf simulator which allows you to play six, randomly-generated holes.  You can select from five clubs each swing, each with different distance ranges.  The game tracks your total strokes and your par.
