# Python Projects

### [Django Checkbook](https://github.com/taylor-peters/Django_Checkbook)
Utilizing the Django framework and static files provided by The Tech Academy, I constructed a basic banking application.

### [Django University Project](https://github.com/taylor-peters/DjangoUniversity)
Utilizing the Django framework, I constructed a simple university administrative program.

### [Golf Simulator](https://github.com/taylor-peters/Python-Projects/commit/803c0541b9fbeb8f5f7beaa37835996d27062324)
Based on fundamentals covered in The Tech Academy's "Nice/Mean" game assignment, I developed this rudimentary golf simulator which allows you to play six, randomly-generated holes.  You can select from five clubs each swing, each with different distance ranges.  The game tracks your total strokes and your par. 

### [Web Page Generator](https://github.com/taylor-peters/Python-Projects/commit/524bbd8421bddd6366e205d6dd0e84f42819e24f)
Part of a series of challenges in The Tech Academy's Python Course.  This basic program utilizes tkinter and webbrowser modules to allow users to insert text into the body of an html document and launch it from a tkinter GUI.
